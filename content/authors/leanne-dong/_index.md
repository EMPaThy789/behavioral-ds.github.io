  I am a Mathematician and a Postdoctoral Fellow at Concordia University, School of Engineering and Computer Science. I completed my last postdoc in computer social media. I built dependence structure between labor occupation based on job counts data, using copulae. I also developed a theoretical model based on hawkes intensity point processes allows fitting information diffusion based on observed counts of events. The main tools we used were functional analysis and distribution theory. I completed my PhD in early 2018 on the topic of stochastic Navier-Stokes equations on the rotating spheres with stable LÃ©vy noise, under supervision of Prof. Beniamin Goldys, the univeristy of Sydney. I have been teaching in universities on various topics for roughly 10 years. Prior to my PhD, I was a researcher in quantitative finance and stochastic processes.

  **Position at UTS:** Leanne was a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the Behavioral Data Science lab in UTS.

  **Next position after UTS:** Leanne moved to Concordia University, Montreal, Canada to start a postdoctoral position.
